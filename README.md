# Kuro Bot v.0.01
###### A Discord bot created by Vitobru and Alatar

**Info:** This is a small Discord bot written sitting on top of the discord.py library. Still in its alpha stages of development, it can perform some basic tasks all prefaced by the ! parameter.

**Prerequisites:** You're gonna need `python.py` and dotenv for this; both of which you can easily install through the terminal, using:
```
pip install -U discord.py
pip install -U python-dotenv
```
